## Context
 


## Datasets
In this section, you will find the list of the data sets used to produce the maps. The data files can be found in the "data" folder. For the data tables, the name of the different variables are listed and explained as well. There are X data sets used in this study.  

+ **AgrAph5.dat:** the first data set contains the data for all the indivudals analyzed. Each line correspond to one individuals and the following information for each individuals can be found in this table: 
  + *indiv_ID*: individual's ID, this is a unique string of character
  + *data_batch*: the global dataset can be divided in several sub-projects (AgrAphid, RAtransect, 


## R scripts
In this section, you will find the list of the different scripts used in the article with a brief description of their purpose.

+ **Agra_load.R:** the script to load the different data sets, functions and packages that are necessary for the data analyses and representation in the R environment. 
+ **Agra_deltaK_fun.R:** functions to perform the delta-K analysis.
